# PolyClonalABAssembler
The project is to build an assembler to assemble polyclonal antibodies (multiple unknown antibody sequences in patients' blood sample). 
Mixed multiple antibodies are cut into small pieces by multiple enzymes and sent into LC/MS spectrometer to generate MS/MS data. The goal is to recover multiple whole antibody sequences from mass spectra data of mixed small fragments of these antibodies.
